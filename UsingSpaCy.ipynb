      "Nearly 300 probable cases of children with severe hepatitis have been detected in 20 countries worldwide, with some in South East Asia, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.,Health officials around the world are investigating a mysterious increase in cases of the liver condition which was first spotted in the UK.,A common virus called adenovirus, which has rebounded after the pandemic, could be causing the surge.,One death has been reported by the WHO.,As of 1 May, it said most cases of young children with hepatitis had been detected in Europe with small numbers also reported in the Americas, western Pacific and South East Asia.,The first cases of this unusual hepatitis were spotted in Scotland in children under the age of 10. More than 140 cases are now being investigated in the UK.,Hepatitis in children: What is causing it?Virus probable cause of mysterious child hepatitisChild hepatitis cases falsely linked to Covid jab,Most UK children had a mild form of liver inflammation, although 10 children have needed a liver transplant.,They had initial symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea followed by yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, called jaundice.,The hepatitis viruses that normally cause the condition (viruses A, B, C, D and E) were not detected in any of the children. ,Countries worldwide started looking for the unexplained liver condition 'of unknown origin' in children after it was highlighted by UK health officials.,There is no reason to believe the rare condition itself is spreading around the world.,The WHO says it's not yet clear if there has been an increase in hepatitis cases, or an increase in awareness of the condition which would normally go undetected.,Scientists believe that a common virus which has rebounded since the pandemic could be playing a role. It has been circulating at much higher levels than normal recently.,Adenovirus was the most common pathogen detected in about three-quarters of the UK children with confirmed hepatitis who were tested.,And a particular type of adenovirus, called F41, was found in many of those samples after testing.,The same adenovirus is also reported to have been found in nine children with hepatitis in the United States.,UK health officials believe young children, who were not exposed to common viruses during the Covid pandemic because of reduced social mixing, are now being infected when they have no previous protection.,There are 50 different types of adenovirus and they generally cause colds, and sometimes sickness and diarrhoea. They rarely cause hepatitis in healthy children.,Health experts are also investigating other causes, such as the emergence of a new strain of adenovirus, a previous Covid infection or both occurring at the same time.,\"While adenovirus is a possible hypothesis, investigations are ongoing for the causative agent,\" the WHO said.\n",
      "NHS bosses in England are urging hospitals to offer staff more overtime and tempt retired employees back, to help tackle waiting lists.,A letter sent by NHS England said tackling the backlog that had grown during the pandemic would require a \"number of high impact actions\".,And many hospitals were already taking innovative approaches to the issue.,More than six million people are on waiting lists for treatment such as knee and hip surgery.,NHS England national clinical director of elective care Stella Vig said NHS staff had, in the past two months, almost halved the number waiting more than two years.,\"We know there is still a long way to go,\" she said.,\"Our staff are our greatest asset in tackling the Covid backlog. ,\"It is essential we continue to support our colleagues, harness their collective skill and draw on their ideas to improve things for patients.\",According to the General Medical Council, 21,000 doctors are due to retire in September. ,And part of the plan would be to tempt some of those back by offering part-time opportunities to:,train studentsrun virtual consultationshelp with follow-up check-ups,Other measures recommended by NHS England are:,removing caps on consultant hours - in some places senior doctors are limited to 40 hours a week - to offer extra shifts where safe offering more bank shifts - overtime opportunities for trust rather than agency staffincreasing the use of NHS reservists - members of the public who have signed up to work for the NHS for at least 30 days a year - to help run wards, feed patients and provide support for the Covid-vaccination programmeexploring taking simple procedures, such as cataract surgery, out of operating theatres and into other parts of the hospital \n",
      "The Covid pandemic has caused the deaths of nearly 15 million people around the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates.,That is 13% more deaths than normally expected over two years.  ,The WHO believes many countries undercounted the numbers who died from Covid - only 5.4 million were reported.,In India, there were 4.7 million Covid deaths, it says - 10 times the official figures - and almost a third of Covid deaths globally. ,The Indian government has questioned the estimate, saying it has \"concerns\" about the methodology, but other studies have come to similar conclusions about the scale of deaths in the country.,The measure used by the WHO is called excess deaths - how many more people died than would normally be expected based on mortality in the same area before the pandemic hit.,India's Covid-19 toll highest in the world - WHO,These calculations also take into account deaths which were not directly because of Covid but instead caused by its knock-on effects, like people being unable to access hospitals for the care they needed. It also accounts for poor record-keeping in some regions, and sparse testing at the start of the crisis.,But the WHO said the majority of the extra 9.5 million deaths seen above the 5.4 million Covid deaths reported were thought to be direct deaths caused by the virus, rather than indirect deaths.,Speaking about the scale of the figures, Dr Samira Asma, from the WHO's data department, said \"It's a tragedy. ,\"It's a staggering number and it's important for us to honour the lives that are lost, and we have to hold policymakers accountable,\" she said.,\"If we don't count the dead, we will miss the opportunity to be better prepared for the next time.\",Alongside India, countries with the highest total excess deaths included Russia, Indonesia, USA, Brazil, Mexico and Peru, the WHO figures suggest. The numbers for Russia are three-and-a-half times the country's recorded deaths.,The report also looks at the rates of excess deaths relative to each country's population size. The UK's excess mortality rate - like America, Spain and Germany - was above the global average during 2020 and 2021.,Countries with low excess mortality rates included China, which is still pursuing a policy of \"zero Covid\" involving mass testing and quarantines, Australia, which imposed strict travel restrictions to keep the virus out of the country, Japan and Norway.,The academics who helped compile the report admit their estimates are more speculative for countries in sub-Saharan Africa, because there is little data on deaths in the region. There were no reliable statistics for 41 out of 54 countries in Africa.,Statistician Prof Jon Wakefield, from Seattle's University of Washington, helped the WHO and told the BBC: \"We urgently need better data collection systems. ,\"It is a disgrace that people can be born and die - and we have no record of their passing. ,\"So we really need to invest in countries' registration systems so we can get accurate and timely data.\" \n",
      "Samaritans ambassador Scarlett Moffatt has revealed that she used the suicide prevention charity for support after feeling low and lonely. ,The TV celebrity, who shot to fame after appearing on Gogglebox and I'm A Celebrity, hopes that sharing her story will help others who may be struggling. ,Samaritans says the Covid pandemic has led to more people calling its helpline about loneliness and isolation. ,It is an issue affecting all ages.,Nearly a third of all callers contacting the charity during the pandemic mentioned it. Prior to that, it was about a quarter. ,Official statistics suggest loneliness during the Covid lockdown has been much more intense in poorer, urban areas and places with a higher proportion of young people. The Office for National Statistics data found people aged between 16 and 24 were the most likely to report feeling lonely. ,Alice Gray, a producer from Cardiff, told the BBC last year how sociable singledom turned into lockdown loneliness, and left her craving human touch after months of no hugs.,She said: \"Being alone in a pandemic without any of my loved ones went against every instinct I had, and I felt like my tank was running on empty in terms of how much longer I could cope.,\"Even when I was at really difficult points, there was no-one to turn to.\",Student friend-finding app tackles lonelinessChatty benches to fight lonelinessI craved human touch after months of no hugs,Scarlett has said she felt \"lost and lonely\" after moving to the capital following her I'm A Celebrity win in 2016. ,She said: \"I remember feeling guilt when I felt lonely - because to many people I have no reason to feel alone, but loneliness affects us all. ,\"Sometimes it can feel like there is a negative stigma around admitting that you're lonely, but it's something that most people will have experienced at one point in their life.

      "A government minister has urged people to choose supermarket value brands, to cope with the cost-of-living crisis. But what effect, if any, will eating cheaper food have on people's health?,Food has become more expensive as producers push their rising energy costs on to consumers - and value items may help cut costs.,Earlier this week, Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary George Eustice said choosing value brands would help shoppers \"manage their household budget\" - comments shadow Treasury minister Pat McFadden described as \"woefully out of touch\".,UK households had the lowest food expenditure in Europe, Mr Eustice said, thanks to a \"very, very competitive retail market, with 10 big supermarkets\".,And with \"the four main ones competing very aggressively - particularly on some of the lower-cost, everyday value items for households, so things like spaghetti and ambient products - there's a lot of competition to keep those prices down\".,But he added it would difficult to keep down the price of fresh chicken because of the cost of feeding the birds and the already super-low profit margins involved in poultry farming. ,The NHS says people should:,have at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a dayuse starchy foods such as potatoes, rice and pasta as a base for mealsinclude some form of dairy, or dairy alternative, and protein such as beans, fish, eggs or meat,Foods high in fat, salt and sugar - and various oils and spreads - should be included in small amounts.,But it can be hard to find supermarket value products that fit in with these guidelines, particularly when it comes to dairy and protein.,BBC Food's budget tipsThe NHS Eatwell GuideWhy food prices are rising so rapidly,Of the 24 items in one of Britain's biggest supermarket's meat and fish \"basics range\",  just one fits in with the NHS guidelines - a pack of pollock steaks - with other options in breadcrumbs or sauce. ,Value ranges also offer less variety for customers looking for \"healthier choice\" options such as reduced salt, sugar or fat versions of their favourite foods. ,And cheaper products will often be bulked out with less costly ingredients to achieve the same volume as their more expensive counterparts but with less nutritional value. ,One value pasta sauce contains:,13% tomatoes and 6% tomato puree, with the rest topped up with water,A similarly sized jar of its expensive branded counterpart contains:, 74% tomatoes, 21% tomato paste and no water,The value sauce is lower in sugar and salt but contains less herbs and spices. ,Luxury supermarket ready meals often cost more than £5 each and boast a recipe list full of fresh and organic ingredients, with many stores also offering calorie-controlled nutritionally balanced meals.,But this is difficult to find within value sections.,One supermarket's value range includes an 85p minced beef hotpot meal.,It contains 19g (0.6oz) of protein, nearly 40% of the recommended daily amount for an adult, but also a third of the recommended amount of salt and 4.4g of saturated fat. ,A beef meal from the store's healthy range, however, contains 23.5g of protein and 2.6g of saturated fat.,A pack of eight value burger patties costs £1.50, meanwhile, the standard ones £5.50.,Both contain similar levels of salt and fat - but:,the more expensive up to 90% beef with seasoning the cheaper 64% bulked out with flour,The standard range also offers leaner burgers with less fat, which the value range does not.,There are lots of ways to eat \"a nutrient-dense diet on a budget\", nutritionist Jenna Hope says.,\"It can sometimes appear more challenging as it does require shoppers to be savvy with their choices and can require extra planning,\" she tells BBC News,These are her top tips: ,Beans and pulses can be a great addition to any meal as they are a source of protein and rich in fibre.,They are also a cheaper way to bulk out mince-based dishes, such as meatballs, shepherd's pie or burgers. ,Dried beans and pulses are more cost-effective than canned - but soaking them pre-cooking is essential to reduce undesirable compounds. ,Fresher produce is more likely to be in the clearance section in the evenings, because of the shorter expiry dates, and if uneaten by the use-by date can be stored in the freezer.,It is a common misconception frozen produce is less nutritionally replete than fresh.,It can be just as nutritionally dense, if not more, as nutrients are often locked in when frozen. ,Fruits and vegetables are much cheaper in the frozen section and often sold in larger quantities. ,Frozen vegetables are brilliant for adding to soups, stews and curries.,Frozen fruit can be made into compote and served with yoghurt or added to smoothies or porridge.,Frozen meat and fish can be a good choice too.,Fresh fish can be more pricey - but canned, such as sardines, is a great way to consume omega-3, a vital nutrient for brain health and cognitive function. ,Wholegrains can be a brilliant way to increase diversity in diet. ,Foods such as rice (brown if possible), wholegrain bread and oats are cheap and nutritious. ,Avoid more expensive pre-cooked or microwaveable rice.,Often, buying own-brand wholefoods, such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy, fruit and vegetables,and cooking from scratch can be cheaper than the convenience versions. ,But when it comes to the more processed foods, the cheaper products can have more additives and bulking agents than the more expensive brands.\n",
      "Covid infections are down considerably in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics, with around one in 33 people thought to be infected. ,Around 1.9m people - roughly 3% of the population - would have tested positive in the week to 30 April - more than 923,000 fewer than the week before.,It is the largest week-on-week drop in the number of infections since the ONS survey began in July 2020.,But despite the reduction \"infections remain high overall\", experts warn.,\"We continue to see a considerable reduction in infections across the UK, with rates at their lowest level in England since the start of the year,\" said Sarah Crofts, Head of Analytical Outputs for the COVID-19 Infection Survey.,\"Despite this, infections remain high overall.\" ,The figures are an estimate, based on testing thousands of people at random in households across the UK.,They provide the most accurate picture of Covid infection since free testing for the public came to an end in England and Scotland. Some free testing will continue in Wales and Northern Ireland until the end of June.,The ONS research found:,One in 35 people in England has Covid (down from one in 25 the previous week)One in 25 in Wales has Covid (down from one in 18)One in 40 in Northern Ireland has Covid (down from one in 25)One in 30 in Scotland has Covid (down from one in 25),Official UK data shows the number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid continues to fall.,Figures had risen from about 1,100 a day in mid-February to nearly 2,400 by the end of March, but they have since dropped to about 1,063 admissions each day.,Meanwhile, the number of hospital patients with the virus in intensive care stands at around 277.\n",
      "UK health officials say they are still no clearer on the cause of a rise in liver inflammation, or hepatitis, in children.,A common adenovirus is thought to play a role, but other possibilities are still being investigated.,In the UK, 163 cases have now been identified, and 11 children have received liver transplants.,Cases have been detected in 20 countries worldwide, with nearly 300 children affected, and one death.,\"It's important that parents know the likelihood of their child developing hepatitis is extremely low,\" said Dr Meera Chand, from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). ,She said parents should still be alert to the signs - particularly jaundice, a yellow tinge in the whites of the eyes - and they should contact a doctor if concerned.,Since last week, another 18 children in the UK with hepatitis have been identified - 118 live in England, 22 in Scotland, 13 in Wales and 10 in Northern Ireland.,The children's most common symptoms were jaundice and vomiting - and most have been under five years old.,Hepatitis in children: What is causing it?Hepatitis detected in nearly 300 children worldwideChild hepatitis cases falsely linked to Covid jab,The UKHSA's latest report on cases says there is \"some apparent reduction in confirmed cases in the past two weeks overall in the UK\".,What's puzzling scientists is that the most likely cause - adenovirus - doesn't normally make children seriously unwell. Passed from person to person via coughs and sneezes, it can cause colds, vomiting and diarrhoea.,However, it's very unusual for adenovirus to be a cause of severe hepatitis in otherwise healthy children, but it has been circulating at high levels since the start of the year after virtually disappearing during the pandemic.,Genetic analysis of samples from some children has found a type of virus called AAV-2 - but it doesn't typically cause illness either, the report says.,Scientists are also keeping a close eye on another type of adenovirus, called F41.,\"Our investigations continue to suggest that there is an association with adenovirus, and our studies are now testing this association rigorously,\" Dr Chand said.,\"We are also investigating other contributors.\",These include whether a new variant of adenovirus has developed which is making children more ill, or whether a previous infection, such as Covid, could be a factor.,Another possibility is that the pandemic, by delaying young children's exposure to a number of different viruses because of reduced social mixing, may have made them more prone to becoming ill.,And health officials are also exploring whether there could be a link with dogs. A number of families affected said they owned dogs or had come into contact with them, but UKHSA also acknowledges that having a pet dog is common in the UK.,The UKHSA says there is no evidence of any link to the Covid-19 vaccine, because most children with hepatitis were too young to receive it.\n",
      "People in England are struggling to get dental treatment, as dentists close to new NHS patients, a watchdog says.,Healthwatch England, the NHS body representing patients, said the problem was made worse by the rising cost of living and needed \"urgent attention\".,It said some people were living in pain, unable to speak or eat properly, because they could not find treatment.,And it warned the poorest were suffering most as they were least able to afford to pay for private dentistry.,Healthwatch England said the issue was creating a two-tier system - dividing the rich and the poor - and called on the government to take action.,\"There is now a deepening crisis,\" said Louise Ansari, of Healthwatch England.,\"With millions of households bearing the brunt of the escalating living costs, private treatment is simply not an option - and even NHS charges can be a challenge. ,\"This needs urgent attention.\",The government said it was increasing investment in services to improve access as well as looking to reform the system.,And a spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care added ministers were \"committed\" to addressing the issues as part of the levelling up agenda.,Ryan Herrmann is in constant pain. One of his fillings fell out two years ago, during the first lockdown. ,Dentists were closed during lockdown, so he soldiered on. Eventually the pain became too much and he went to an emergency service and was given a temporary filling.,That filling later fell out, however. But when dental services were fully open again, he could not find an NHS dentist in the area willing to accept new patients. He had recently moved to Wiltshire from London and had not had the opportunity to register at a new practice.,\"Tooth pain sends you mad,\" he said. \"You feel irritable, can't relax and are constantly on edge. I'm angry - really angry. ,\"If I had money I could afford private treatment next week. It feels like we're being told, if you're poor -you're not worthy of treatment.\",The recent warning by Healthwatch England comes after the NHS body commissioned a survey of more than 2,000 adults in England. The survey was then examined, alongside feedback from local NHS teams.,The poll found around half of those surveyed had visited an NHS dentist in the past two years. ,Of those: ,41% said it had been difficult to book an appointment20% said they could not access all the treatments they required17% felt pressurised to pay privately,Of those that had not seen an NHS dentist, the majority either did not need treatment, chose not to go to the dentist or were prepared to pay for private care. ,But more than a fifth - 21% - said they had wanted to get NHS treatment, but had been unable to find any dental services locally.,Healthwatch said a combination of factors appear to be contributing to the problem - with a long-standing shortage of NHS provision exacerbated by more dentists closing their lists to NHS patients during the pandemic, as well as some staff retiring.,The rising cost of living was also making it more difficult for people to pay for treatment, both privately and on the NHS, which typically only subsidises treatment rather than providing it for free.,The British Dental Association said there had been inadequate funding for NHS dentistry for the past decade, calling the current contract \"dysfunctional\", as it provided insufficient reward for treating patients.,BDA chair Shawn Charlwood added: \"Shameful inequalities are set to widen. For over a decade this services has been running on empty, with patients paying more just so the Treasury can pay less. ,\"Choices made by government mean dentists are now walking away from the NHS.\"\n",
      "High Street chemists have run out of some hay-fever medicine, as a UK industry-wide shortage hits supplies. ,Stocks of chlorphenamine maleate, the active ingredient in brands such as Piriton, are limited, Boots says. ,The chain said it still had a large range of other hay-fever medicines in stores and online. ,Pollen counts will remain medium to high across much of the UK this week, the Met Office says.,A Boots official said: \"There are a very small number of lines that are currently out of stock due to a current, industry-wide shortage of the active ingredient. ,\"However, we are expecting this to be resolved soon and new deliveries are expected in the coming weeks.\",Boots says it has over 90 hay fever relief products - four are impacted by the shortage. ,Some hay-fever medication, including chlorphenamine, can cause drowsiness.,Those affected should avoid driving, riding a bike and using tools or machinery. ,As well as a variety of pills, shops sell nasal sprays and eye drops that can relieve symptoms, such as itchy eyes and runny nose. ,The NHS also suggests:,Vaseline around the nostrils, to trap pollenwraparound sunglasses, to prevent pollen reaching the eyesstaying indoors with windows and doors shutshowering and changing clothes after going outside,Medicine shortages are not new and can be due to manufacturing issues, global demand or disruption with the supply chain. Royal Pharmaceutical Society president Claire Anderson said pharmacists and pharmacy teams were used to managing and dealing with them. ,At the end of April, the government appointed a hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) tsar to tackle drug shortages affecting products used by about a million women in the UK to treat menopause symptoms.,What is hay fever?Surviving hay fever,Hay fever, also known as allergic rhinitis, affects almost 10 million people in England, of all ages. That's almost one in four adults and one in 10 children.,It is caused by an allergic response to allergens, such as pollen. Some people are triggered by tree pollen - typically around March to mid-May - and others by grass or weed pollen which come slightly later in the season. ,When this happens, the body makes a chemical called histamine. ,Drugs called antihistamines - chlorphenamine is an antihistamine - can help with the symptoms. ,Some of the symptoms of hay fever overlap with those of Covid.,If you think you may have a respiratory infection, such as Covid, try to avoid contact with other people, especially those at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell.\n",
      "Fourth-dose Covid booster vaccines increase protection against Covid-19, particularly in people aged over 70, according to a UK trial.,But scientists say any short-term protection against infection is likely to fall away quickly.,The UK rolled out fourth doses to over-75s and the most vulnerable in April.,A larger group of people may be offered a booster in the autumn, but any decision will be based on advice from the UK's vaccine committee. ,It is likely to look at whether new worrying variants are spreading, and Covid pressure on hospitals.,Some countries, such as Israel and Germany, have already started offering all adults a fourth dose.,Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said the study findings were \"further evidence underlining the importance of people coming forward for their booster as soon as they are eligible\".,Who can book an extra Covid booster?Learning to live with Covid in the UKWhat's the guidance for Covid in the UK now?,The study of 133 people, two weeks after their fourth dose, found the vaccines were \"well-tolerated\" and \"boosted immunity\".,The researchers said \"peak responses after the fourth dose were similar to, and possibly better than, peak responses after the third dose\".,But the study, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, concluded that a large increase in anti-spike antibodies would probably wane rapidly, as was seen after third doses.,All participants, some of whom were over 70 and some under 70, were vaccinated with a dose of Pfizer or a half dose of Moderna about six months after having their third dose.,\"There was good boosting in all groups, particularly for the over-70s, and the half dose of Moderna was slightly higher,\" said Prof Saul Faust, Cov-Boost, study leader from the University of Southampton.,Another part of the immune system called T-cells were also boosted after the fourth dose, which suggests longer-lasting protection against severe disease was increased.,Prof Faust pointed out that the recent Omicron wave means most people will have been infected recently and now have high antibody levels, which means they are unlikely to gain much from another dose.,The study is small and more research is needed over a longer time frame to track how long the immune response lasts.,The UK regulator, the MHRA, decides whether vaccines are safe to use, while the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation advises health ministers on whether they should be used and who would benefit from them.,adults aged 75 and overresidents in care homes for older adultsthose aged 12 and over with weakened immune systems,You can book an appointment online three months (91 days) after your previous dose.

      "Relentless. Unbearable. Overwhelming.  ,These are just some of the words used by the thousands of people who have revealed their battle with long-term, persistent pain.,An exclusive survey of over 4,000 adults aged 16-75 for BBC News, carried out by research company Ipsos, suggests that a quarter of people in the UK are living with chronic pain - an often hidden and misunderstood condition. ,And pain specialists warn the health service is not set up to deal with such complex conditions. They say the treatments on offer are decades behind the science, leaving millions of patients without the support they need to manage their pain.,Chronic pain - defined as pain that lasts longer than three months - can drastically change people's lives. It can be caused by a physical problem - such as a slipped disc, but can also occur with no clear cause - known as primary pain. It destroys careers, breaks up relationships, steals independence and denies people the futures they had imagined.,Jen Proudler says chronic pain has left her grieving for \"the person she was\".,It started four years ago with sporadic back pain, which she managed with the help of hot baths and paracetamol. Now she relies on opioid patches, anti-inflammatories, nerve pain medications and beta-blockers just to get through the day.,\"It has flipped everything upside down,\" she says. \"I feel I've lost every part of my life. I've lost me.\",Jen, 38, who lives with her partner in Farsley near Leeds, was working as a dental hygienist and had a busy social life when she first started experiencing pain in February 2018.,Her doctor said it was a problem with a disc in her back and advised taking some time off. Jen rested for about eight weeks, then went back to work. The pain hadn't gone away but she felt she needed to get back to \"some kind of normality\".,\"There were days when it was really bad, but I have this attitude of battling through it, because that's what you do,\" she says.,But nine months after the pain first began, Jen was driving to work when she felt the most excruciating pain. \"It was how I would imagine being kicked in the back by a horse.\" Later that day she lost all sensation in her right leg.,That was the last time she made it to work.,After several incorrect diagnoses, Jen was eventually told by a neurosurgeon that she had a \"pretty massive\" far lateral disc herniation in her spine - a slipped disc that then compresses the nerves around it. But by then something was going on - her body's defence system had gone into overdrive in response to the agony she was experiencing. The pain has now spread around her body - Jen has burning pins and needles sensations down her leg, as well as sharp pain, as if being cut by a razor. Sometimes it's so bad, she can't even bear any fabric to touch it.,\"Our nervous system becomes more and more protective, it feels danger and sends warning signals - and those warning signals contribute to the pain,\" explains Dr Chris Barker, clinical director of an NHS community pain service in Ainsdale, Merseyside.,He says such pain can be hard to diagnose, and the difficulty of getting the correct treatment can make things worse. \"Incorrect diagnoses, delayed diagnoses, poor experiences in and out of the health system, not being believed - all of these can contribute to a more intense experience of pain.\" ,Dr Barker says the NHS is not set up to deal with such a complex condition, despite the fact it is so common. \"The prevalence of pain is huge. It dwarfs most other conditions.\" ,The BBC study is the most recent snapshot - previous studies have found chronic pain affects between 20-50% of the UK - and the prevalence may be even higher in older age groups. ,Persistent pain that lasts more than three months, despite medication or other forms of treatmentSecondary chronic pain is a pain which tends to be caused by another condition, for example, arthritis, endometriosis, cancer painPrimary chronic pain is a condition in its own right - there is no known condition other than the pain itself - this can include conditions such as fibromyalgia or complex regional pain syndromeChronic pain is often confused with acute pain - a short-term pain such as a broken bone or a torn muscle  ,Latest guidelines from the health regulator National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) say chronic primary pain should not be treated with opioids, or even paracetamol, while in Scotland, opioids can be prescribed for chronic pain in certain cases. ,Yet the results from BBC's Ipsos survey suggest nearly a quarter of those who live with chronic pain are currently taking opioids - ranging from medication such as codeine to more powerful painkillers like morphine and fentanyl.,Opioids are useful for short-term, acute pain, but there is little evidence they help long-term, persistent pain. Despite this, opioid prescribing more than doubled between 1998 to 2018. It prompted the MHRA, the UK's medicine regulator, to issue stronger warnings around the risk of addiction and overdose. ,Our research suggests that more than 40% of those currently using opioids began taking them over five years ago, before these warnings were issued.,Sitting at her kitchen table, packets of pills stacked up nearby, Jen says every day now revolves around managing her pain. Despite the support of her GP, she is struggling to see a way forward. She says the medication helps her function, but she worries she's running out of options in the long term. ,Pain specialists believe the science calls for a different approach involving more support, more tailored care and most importantly, more options of how to cope with such a life-changing condition.,Chronic pain: Antidepressants not painkillers recommended ,Dr Cathy Stannard, clinical lead on persistent pain for NICE, says medication like opioids has very little benefit for people with certain types of chronic pain. She fears millions of patients are not getting the bespoke treatment needed for such a complex condition. But the other options are a difficult sell to a patient in distress - especially in an under-pressure health service where they often don't get the chance to build up a trusting, empathetic relationship.,\"People who are living with pain very understandably present with high levels of distress. When they say, 'Are you going to leave me in pain?' it is very difficult to say 'Yes.' It is always with the best intentions that we prescribe medicines, but often, it is a response to distress rather than a rational clinical decision.\",Patients tend to need the support of their GP, physiotherapists, psychologists and pharmacists. Depending on the condition, medication can be helpful but may only be part of the treatment - other elements that help include:,ExercisePhysical therapies (hot or cold packs, massage, hydrotherapy)PhysiotherapyAcupuncturePsychological therapies (trauma therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, meditation)Community support groups,Dr Stannard stresses the NICE guidelines were not written to take medication away from people who feel it is helping them. The problem, she says, is the lack of options or tailored treatment for such a complex condition - and too often medication becomes the only answer, instead of part of it.,And no-one should stop or change their medication without speaking to their doctor.,Benjamin Ellis, a consultant rheumatologist and senior policy advisor for the charity Versus Arthritis, agrees, and says that while opioids can help people manage some conditions like osteoarthritis, too often they are seen as a long-term answer.,\"The health system is set up to support the prescribing of medication rather than supporting patients to access other treatments - physical activity, programmes to help people with their mental health, community support, peer support - they're not so readily available, and even where they are, they're not well connected with health services.\",Lorraine English's story illustrates the potential dangers of being prescribed opioids long term.,She was a busy single mum with four kids, working as a teaching assistant, when she started to notice pain that had started in her neck and spread into her head and back.,It led to her taking high doses of opioids, including morphine, for 12 years - at times she says she felt like her life was over. \"It was so frightening, so isolating\".,Lorraine, from Burnage, south Manchester, was eventually diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia - a condition which causes all-over body pain and extreme tiredness.,\"I would get nerve pain shooting through my head and it would cause migraines, light-sensitivity - just my heel touching the floor would send pain up into my head.\",As the pain continued, her opioid dose increased, while her ability to cope decreased.,Eventually she had to give up work, taking pill after pill to beat what is known as \"breakthrough pain\" - a flare-up of pain despite being on huge doses of painkillers.,For the last three years of her life on morphine, Lorraine was unable to function - bed-bound, existing in a fog of medication, her life ruled by pain.,\"It's like being in a medicated coma and you can't reach out to anybody, because you're not even aware anyone's out there. I felt like that for years, just laid in bed with my kids checking on me, asking, 'You okay?'\",Lorraine says she realised that she needed to reduce her medication - not only was she struggling to function, but she felt it was making the pain worse.,It took nearly a year, but with the help of her GP, Lorraine has gradually tapered off her opioid medication, and the pain has reduced.,Now opioid-free, she says she has learned to \"embrace\" the pain she still feels, and understand her body's limits.,\"No matter how much pain I am in, I want to be able to manage it so I can hug my grandkids,\" she says.,People who live with chronic pain have told us how difficult it is to access any specialist services.,Our research suggests that nearly a quarter (23%) of those living with chronic pain are on waiting lists for surgery or a pain management programme.,An NHS spokesperson said more clinical pharmacists and trained staff are being recruited and will be based at GP surgeries so patients can get access to specialist care and be \"offered alternatives to medication where appropriate\".,There are areas of the UK which are offering a whole patient approach, like at Dr Barker's clinic in Ainsdale, Merseyside, where he leads a team of pharmacists, physiotherapists and psychologists.,Over the last 20 years, he says, the scientific understanding of pain - how our brains respond, how we process it - has been transformed.,Hurt does not always equal harm, he explains, and someone can be in pain without any physical injury. \"Our traditional model of thinking about pain is about MRI scans and looking for structural things - the problem is we interpret that to mean that's going to be the cause of pain.\",Chronic pain is far more complex than that - an overly sensitised nervous system can change a normal signal from one of the body's sensors into a threat signal which our brain then interprets as pain.,There may be many complex reasons why the nervous system has been put on \"red alert\", he says. If people are dealing with trauma, stress or grief, that can contribute to chronic pain. ,A Life Of Pain,The BBC News investigation unearths huge numbers of people living with chronic pain. In an exclusive documentary, Dominic Hughes hears stories from those in pain, across the UK.,Watch on BBC iPlayer now.,This is why, Dr Barker says, sharing experiences can play a vital role when living with pain. Many of his patients attend Pain Clinic Plus, a peer support group at his clinic.,\"People tend to become isolated because they can't do what they used to do, so people stop phoning them,\" says Kev Howard, one of the organisers, who has lived with pain for years following a shoulder injury.,\"It's so easy to sit at home and take a pill and fall asleep. The other way to go is to pop into groups similar to this, and basically have a laugh - because while you're laughing you're not crying.\"\n",
      "US scientists say they have discovered what caused thousands of soldiers who served in the 1991 Gulf War to fall sick with mysterious symptoms.,They have pinned the blame on the nerve agent sarin, which was released into the air when caches of Iraqi chemical weapons were bombed.,Many veterans have complained of a range of debilitating symptoms which developed after their service.,But for decades the cause of Gulf War Syndrome has remained elusive.,Gulf War syndrome 'not caused by depleted uranium'Why hasn't the mystery of Gulf War Syndrome been solved?,Sarin is usually deadly, but lead researcher Dr Robert Haley said the gas that soldiers were exposed to in Iraq was diluted, and so not fatal.,\"But it was enough to make people ill if they were genetically predisposed to illness from it.\",Dr Haley said the key to whether somebody fell ill was a gene known as PON1, which plays an important role in breaking down toxic chemicals in the body.,His team found veterans with a less effective version of the PON1 gene were more likely to become sick. ,The latest study - largely funded by the US government - involved more than 1,000 randomly-selected American Gulf War veterans.  ,Dr Haley, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, said: \"This is the most definitive study.,\"We believe it will stand up to any criticism. And we hope our findings will lead to treatment that will relieve some of the symptoms.\",More than 50,000 British troops served in the war which followed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.,The Royal British Legion said research suggests up to 33,000 UK Gulf War veterans could be living with the syndrome, with 1,300 claiming a war pension for conditions connected to their service in the Gulf.,Over the past three decades, the veterans say they have struggled to have their illness taken seriously. ,Before the war, Kerry Fuller from Dudley, West Midlands, was a fit 26-year old who loved climbing and went to the gym several times a week. Now it's a daily battle simply to get out of bed.  ,At the age of 40, he had a stroke. Now 58, he says he has such excruciating muscle and joint pain that he screams so loudly when he moves in the night that he wakes his whole household. He suffers from problems with his balance, memory and speech.   ,\"Even when I was still in the military, I was getting illness after illness, breathing problems, chronic fatigue,\" he said.,\"And when I questioned whether it could be anything to do with my service in the Gulf or what we were exposed to, the military line was 'You're talking nonsense, there's no evidence. Two paracetamol. Crack on'.\"  ,The National Gulf Veterans and Families Association, a charity working with British ex-soldiers who are ill, welcomed the study. ,\"For 30 years they have been disowned, ignored and lied to by consecutive governments, with no positive answers to their questions about exposure to toxic substances and gases and the affect it had on them both physically and mentally,\" it said in a statement.,\"We hope the UK government takes this report on board and will respond by offering Gulf veterans access/opportunity to have the tests. ,\"This will hopefully lead to more meaningful and proper medical treatment which they have for too long been denied.\",The Ministry of Defence said: \"We continue to monitor and welcome any new research that is published around the world and financial support is available to veterans whose illness is due to service through the MoD War Pensions and the Armed Forces occupational pension schemes.\",But the Royal British Legion said there had been \"little meaningful research\" on Gulf War Syndrome in the UK.,Professor Randall Parrish, of the University of Portsmouth, published a study last year which ruled out depleted uranium as a cause.,He said: \"I think this is a great example of an issue that has required a long-term effort to solve, but which only a few scientists have persisted in - others giving up and assuming it is either not a real illness or too complex to solve, and funding agencies not wanting to wade too deeply in the politics of it.\"\n",
      "Doctors and paramedics have told the BBC that long waits for ambulances across the UK are having a \"dangerous impact\" on patient safety. ,BBC analysis found a 77% rise in the most serious safety incidents logged by paramedics in England over the past year, compared to before the pandemic. ,In Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the 999 system is also under \"tremendous pressure\", doctors say.,NHS England said the safety of patients is its \"absolute priority\".,In October, nine-year-old Willow Clark fell off her bike on a country path in Hertfordshire, cracking her helmet and leaving her with a fractured skull and a nine-inch laceration across her leg.,\"I could see it was a really bad accident and I was 20 minutes away from home screaming for help,\" said her mother Sam. \"These really nice people who were passing by phoned 999.,\"They explained she had a severe head injury and her leg was badly hurt but we were told it would be a 10-hour wait for an ambulance and we'd have to get her to hospital ourselves.\",Sam's husband had to drive through a farmer's field to pick up his daughter. ,When they got to A&E, Willow was immediately transferred to the trauma department. Doctors told her family that she should not have been moved because of her back and neck injuries.,\"It's the first time I've ever had to phone an ambulance and I was so disappointed,\" said Sam. \"When we really needed it, help just wasn't there and it should have been.\",She later found out that Willow had been classified as an \"urgent\" category three case, meaning an ambulance should have arrived within 120 minutes.,East of England Ambulance Service said it was under \"significant pressure\" that day because of a high number of 999 calls and was asking some patients to make their own way to hospital. ,It has apologised, and said Willow - now 10 - should have been dealt with as a more critical category two case.,Willow's experience, although traumatic for her family, was not recorded as a serious safety incident by the NHS. ,To reach that threshold, an incident must have potentially led to long-term harm or death. ,BBC research shows there were 551 serious safety reports filed by ambulance staff in England between March 2021 and February 2022, up from 312 in the same period before the pandemic.,Within that data, there were 201 unintended or unexpected deaths, up from 78 in 2019/20.,The data does depend on staff deciding to report problems, and not all serious incidents will be linked to long ambulance delays. The largest proportion though do relate to the 'access, admission or transfer' of patients.,Coroners and lawyers have highlighted recent cases including:,Staffordshire's assistant coroner issued a 'prevention of future deaths' warning after a patient in Stoke died after waiting eight hours for an ambulanceThe family of a man who died after waiting nine hours for treatment has issued a legal challenge against the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service over a \"chronic shortage\" of ambulancesThe London Ambulance service is investigating after a man died when paramedics took almost 70 minutes to respond to a suspected heart attack,Dr Katherine Henderson, an A&E consultant and president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC's Today programme the problem with ambulance waits was \"more serious than we've ever seen it\".,She said: \"We've got big queues - we can't get flow out of our departments. The underlying reason is that emergency departments are absolutely packed.\",Dr Henderson explained the bottleneck was caused by emergency departments having to wait to move patients into wards.,All 10 of England's major ambulance trusts have raised their internal alert level to a point indicating they are under severe or extreme pressure, research for the BBC has found. ,The latest data from NHS England shows that response times are now at their highest since the current system was introduced five years ago.,In April, crews were responding to a \"life-threatening\" callout in nine minutes and two seconds on average, significantly above the seven-minute national target. ,The response time for a category two emergency, such as a heart attack or a stroke, has risen to more than 51 minutes, almost three times longer than the 18-minute target.,One paramedic, who often works as a clinical call handler, told the BBC: \"Sitting staring at a screen with over 400 people waiting for an ambulance is soul-destroying.,\"Do the delays mean people are dying? Absolutely, but we also need to be educating people on when someone really needs an ambulance.\",She said that on one recent shift, the longest wait for a category two emergency was more than 15 hours, for an elderly man with abdominal pain.,The patient hadn't phoned again overnight and no welfare calls had taken place. When the crew arrived the next morning, they found the man dead.,There are different factors behind the long waiting times.,The ambulance service is seeing record levels of demand this year, as Covid restrictions have been lifted. ,More than 860,000 calls to 999 were answered in England in April, 20% higher than in the same month in 2019.,There is a national shortage of paramedics across the UK, and Covid has still been causing disruption - with higher levels of staff sickness over the winter.,Crucially though, ambulance crews themselves have faced long delays when they pick up patients and then try to deliver them to hospital staff in a busy emergency department.,In the first week of April, around one in ten patients had to wait more than an hour for their ambulance to be unloaded in England, far higher than the same week last year, and well above the 15-minute NHS target.,Another paramedic told the BBC that those kinds of waits were having a 'dangerous impact' on patient safety. ,\"We are doing the job to provide emergency care and to save lives, but actually now we are just an extended ward of the hospital,\" he said.,\"I'm meant to care for a patient who had been in the back of my ambulance for 14 hours, but nobody has ever really taught me how to look after someone like that.\",The Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE), which represents services across the whole UK, says handover delays cut the number of hours crews could operate by \"up to one-third\" in some areas in March.,\"The potential harm... could be impacting thousands of patients every month, with obvious knock-on effects on the morale and wellbeing of staff,\" managing director Martin Flaherty said.,\"Every possible effort is being made to prioritise those patients whose conditions are most serious. ,\"Sadly, given the loss of capacity associated with handover delays, this is simply not always possible to achieve.\",BBC News has spoken to patients in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who have experienced similarly long waits:,Last week, one in 10 ambulances across Scotland took more than 80 minutes to drop patients at an emergency departmentWelsh Ambulance Service figures show just 51% of immediately life-threatening calls were reached within the target time of eight minutes in March, well below the 65% targetIn Northern Ireland, ambulance delays could have contributed to 14 deaths in the past year, the service's chief executive told BBC News,An NHS England official said it was working closely with ambulance trusts and care homes to free up more capacity in accident and emergency departments.,\"The safety of patients is our absolute priority and it is a good thing that more staff are being encouraged to report all incidents to help prevent repetition,\" she said. ,\"There's no doubt the last few months have been some of the toughest ever for NHS staff, with ambulances responding to the highest number of 999 calls on record over the past year, while more than a 10th of all hospital beds have been filled by people fit to be discharged to services such as social-care providers.\",A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson in England said \"a record £36bn\" from the health and social care levy was being provided over the next three years for the NHS and social care.,There is also a plan to tackle the Covid backlog, and additional funding this year to support increased NHS 111 capacity in taking calls, to ensure people only visit A&E when necessary.,\"We recognise the unprecedented pressure NHS staff are under from the pandemic - especially frontline ambulance workers,\" the spokesperson said.,Additional reporting by Victoria Park.,Have you experienced a long delay, either waiting for an ambulance or at A&E?

      "Gordon Brown has warned that the world risks \"sleepwalking\" into another Covid variant crisis if it does not increase vaccinations in low-income countries. ,Wealthier countries needed to share the cost of global vaccinations, tests and treatments, he told the BBC.,Speaking before an international Covid summit on Thursday, the former UK prime minister said the world had become \"complacent\" about the virus. ,US President Joe Biden is due to host the virtual summit at the White House.,He does so at a time when Congress has failed to approve key funds earmarked for the global pandemic response. ,Campaigners fear that could mean other countries will not offer extra money either, leaving the push for better vaccine coverage around the world without momentum.,Mr Brown, who is a World Health Organization (WHO) ambassador on health finance, said the numbers were \"shocking\". ,\"Only 11% have been vaccinated in low-income countries and we set a target of 70%,\" he said.,\"Tragically, we are sleepwalking into the next variant, and political leaders are still not listening to the medical advice that is still there - that we've got to increase vaccination, continue to test at a high level, and provide the new treatments available.\",Mr Brown said that if wealthy countries did not pay for what is needed now, they might face huge economic costs later if a more lethal variant emerges in low-income countries and is detected too late.,He also said daily testing in poorer countries was only averaging five tests per 100,000 people, rather than the goal of 100 per 100,000, as suggested by the WHO.,Congress has so far been reluctant to approve extra funds of $5bn (£4bn) for international vaccination programmes. ,Mr Brown and other former leaders have written to Mr Biden urging the United States to keep up the momentum on the global vaccination push. ,Mr Brown said: \"I think the Americans have forgotten that if they take no action, then the virus will spread from places that are least vaccinated and least protected, and it will come back to haunt them - even if they've been vaccinated four times.\",The WHO says there's a $15bn financing gap which richer countries need to fill collectively if the developing world is to have the right tools to fight the pandemic properly. But pressure groups are not expecting countries like the UK to allocate any more money than it has already.,In Africa, more than 45 faith leaders have also called for \"immediate action to address the massive inequalities in the global pandemic response\". ,In a joint statement, the religious leaders point out that only one in five Africans has received their first dose of vaccine, while high-income countries are rolling out third and fourth doses.  ,The Archbishop of Cape Town, Thabo Makgoba, is one of those urging world politicians \"not to see this as just a number, but as a reminder that each statistic represents a human being who deserves dignity and the ability to thrive in a post-pandemic world\".\n",
      "The scope of the UK public inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemic has widened to include a focus on children.,When the draft terms were published in March, there was criticism that they failed to even mention the impact on children and young people.,But after a public consultation, the final terms have been published and now incorporate the effect on the health, wellbeing and education of children.,The inquiry's public hearings are not due to start until 2023.,They will be chaired by former High Court judge Baroness Hallett.,The final terms of reference were decided following a four-week public consultation on the draft terms.,As well as expanding the terms to include the impact on the health, wellbeing and education of children and young people, the inquiry will also look at the wider mental health impact across the population.,The focus on inequalities will also be strengthened, the inquiry said, so that the unequal impact on different sections of society will be considered at all stages.,Alongside these issues, the UK-wide inquiry will also look at the following issues which were included originally:,the UK's preparedness for the pandemicthe use of lockdowns and other \"non-pharmaceutical\" interventions, such as social distancing and the use of face coveringsthe management of the pandemic in hospitals and care homes the procurement and provision of equipment like personal protective equipment and ventilators support for businesses and jobs, including the furlough scheme, as well as benefits and sick pay,In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Baroness Hallett said: \"I believe these changes will ensure the inquiry can best fulfil its purpose to examine the UK's preparedness and response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and learn lessons for the future.\",It will now be up to Mr Johnson to agree to the terms of reference.,In the UK, more than 176,000 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus since the start of the pandemic in early 2020.,A report published last week by the World Health Organization found the UK had seen just above average number of total excess deaths during the pandemic - in line with other Western European countries such as Spain, Italy and Germany.,Ex-judge to chair Covid pandemic inquiryWhen will the UK's Covid public inquiry happen?Judge appointed to lead Scottish Covid-19 inquiry,Several reports have already put the UK government's handling of the pandemic under the spotlight.,Last October, a report by MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee said the UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures.,And a report by spending watchdog the National Audit Office last November found ministers were not properly prepared for a pandemic like Covid, and lacked detailed plans on shielding, job support schemes and school disruption.,The government said the unprecedented pandemic had challenged health systems around the world - not just in the UK.,The Scottish government has already published the terms of reference for its own Covid inquiry, to be led by Judge Lady Poole.,Anne Longfield, the former Children's Commissioner and Chair of the Commission Young Lives, said: \"This a very welcome decision. It would have been appalling to airbrush children out of the Covid inquiry after the enormous sacrifices they made and the huge impact the pandemic had.\"\n",
      "A new oral tablet could help thousands of women with benign womb growths, called fibroids, avoid invasive surgery, say experts advising the NHS. ,Watchdog the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says Ryeqo pills should be added to the treatment options considered if a woman has moderate to severe symptoms.,That includes heavy and painful periods.,Sometimes, the growths and associated bloating make a woman look pregnant. ,They can also lead to infertility.,Fibroids are really common - affecting one in three women, but particularly those who are black. ,BBC Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo has spoken openly about her experience of living with fibroids. ,She told Radio 1's Life Hacks: \"A lot of people don't know what they are. So they are basically non-cancerous growths that can appear on the womb. ,\"The blessing is they are non-cancerous, which is a plus, but they still cause a lot of problems around fertility, enjoyment of sexy time, with your digestive system, with your urinary system, heavy periods.,\"I developed anaemia because my periods were very heavy. I was losing a lot of blood because of them.\",She recently had surgery to remove six large ones. ,\"I had what is called a laparoscopic myomectomy. That meant they made three incisions - they went through my belly button and made two incisions in my abdomen and then they go in with a machine, and they basically shred the fibroid in you and then like suck it out. ,\"The recovery was so tough. It was keyhole surgery but it was still invasive.\",Heavy or painful periodsTummy (abdominal) painLower back painFrequent need to urinateConstipationPain or discomfort during sexBloating,Source: NHS,Surgery may still be the best option for some women. There are also injections available that can shrink fibroids. ,Painkillers and hormonal birth control pills or coils are another option that may provide relief.,Fibroids do not need to be treated if they are not causing symptoms. Over time, they will often shrink and disappear without treatment, particularly after the menopause.,The Ryeqo tablets contain a combination of medication - relugolix with estradiol and norethisterone acetate - and are designed to be taken daily at home to help control symptoms. ,Research suggests they can be used in the long term and should not affect fertility. ,About 4,500 women with uterine fibroids will be eligible for a new oral treatment in England and Wales, says NICE, and it should become available within the next few months now that the guidance has been published. ,Helen Knight, interim director of medicines evaluation in the NICE Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said: \"Uterine fibroids can have a profound effect on quality of life. Along with the many debilitating symptoms, there is a real lack of long-term options.,\"This treatment has the potential to improve quality of life. As well as effectively reducing symptoms, it can be taken at home and is therefore more convenient than the injectable treatment, given in a hospital setting.,\"It can also be used long term, which could mean improved and sustained symptom relief, it is well-tolerated, and it will mean thousands of women can avoid invasive surgery which always carries some risk.\"\n",
      "Covid infections continue to decrease in the UK with around one in 45 or just over two in every 100 people thought to be infected. ,The estimates - from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - show levels of the virus are at the lowest since mid-December.,It means around 1.48m people would have tested positive in the week to 7 May.,The figures are an estimate, based on testing thousands of people at random in households across the UK.,They provide the most accurate picture of Covid infection since free testing for the public came to an end in England and Scotland. Some free testing will continue in Wales and Northern Ireland until the end of June.,Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the ONS Covid Infection Survey, said: \"It is encouraging to see infections continue to decrease across the UK.\",The ONS research found:,One in 45 people in England has Covid (down from one in 35 the previous week)One in 35 in Wales has Covid (down from one in 25)One in 55 in Northern Ireland has Covid (down from one in 40)One in 35 in Scotland has Covid (down from one in 30),Official UK data shows the number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid continues to fall.,Figures had risen from about 1,100 a day in mid-February to nearly 2,400 by the end of March, but they have since dropped to about 860 admissions each day.,The number of hospital patients with the virus in intensive care stands at around 200.,Meanwhile, another survey by the ONS suggests many people previously considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable to Covid and who were asked to shield at home earlier in the pandemic are continuing to take precautions to protect themselves. ,And around one in 10 of the 1,036 people surveyed said they were still following the shielding advice, even though it ended in 2021.,More than half (59%) of respondents reported that the pandemic had a negative effect on them and 78% felt that it should be the law for those who test positive for Covid to self-isolate. \n",
      "When you think of cancer, a glamorous mum in her mid-30s is not the first image that springs to mind. ,But You, Me and the Big C podcaster Dame Deborah James was just 35 when she found out she had bowel cancer. Blood and stool tests had come back normal and her GP had laughed \"not once, but three times over the course of six months\" at the idea she could possibly have a tumour in her bowels. The diagnosis came only when she paid to have her colon examined privately. ,Her experience has raised questions about how good we are at spotting and treating cancer in the under-40s. Simply - are we failing young people with cancer?,There is a big challenge here - cancer is rare when you're a child or a young adult. ,Cancers in toddlers do happen, but they are incredibly rare. The risk builds with every birthday, and then rises rapidly after we turn 55. ,The longer we live, the more time our bodies' cells have to build up the mutations that turn healthy cells cancerous. At the same time our immune system, which also mops up cancerous cells, becomes less effective.,So overall, around 4.3% of cancers diagnosed in the UK are in the under-40s, while those over 75 make up more than a third of all cancer cases. ,This poses a challenge for us and the doctors who treat us.,When we are young, we're less likely to attribute any ill health to cancer. Changes to our bowel movements could just be stress, blood in the toilet after we poo could be inflammatory bowel disease or haemorrhoids. Because, for most people, cancer is something that happens to our parents or grandparents.,Charlotte Maden, who's 38 and from Lancashire, was shocked when she was diagnosed with bowel cancer in February.,\"I never thought bowel cancer would be an issue for me - I'm young, healthy, not overweight, don't smoke, don't drink much - I'm really quite a fit person,\" she says. ,Charlotte says her friends \"think they are invincible, and it will never happen to them\". ,Your doctor should be alert to major warning signs of cancer, but there is a medical saying: \"When you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras\". It's a call to look for the most common or likely explanation, and the younger you are, the less likely cancer is to be behind your symptoms. This helps channel the health service's limited resources to those most likely to need them. ,But that means some younger people aren't being seen quickly enough, although the problem can affect older people too. Bowel Cancer UK's Never Too Young report in 2020 found that four in 10 people surveyed had to visit their GP three or more times before being referred for further tests to see if they had cancer.,\"I don't think GPs are a problem,\" says Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK. \"It [bowel cancer] is rare in younger people... It will usually be something else.\",The question is - what if you are the zebra, that relatively rare case who does have cancer at a young age?,Charlotte, who has two children aged five and seven, credits her GP with being \"really thorough\" when she noticed blood in her stools on a couple of occasions. She was diagnosed following two colonoscopies, and had surgery less than three weeks later.,\"If the doctor had said it was probably just piles, I might not have come back. I probably owe her a lot really.\" ,One of the most important things is diagnosing cancer at an early stage. The earlier that tumours are found, the easier they are to treat.,Stage 1 cancers - are small, but haven't spreadStage 2 cancers - are larger, but still haven't spreadStage 3 cancers - have now spread to some of the surrounding tissue such as lymph nodesStage 4 cancers - have spread to another organ in the body, creating a secondary tumour,Data from Cancer Research UK shows that, on the whole, cancers in younger people are being found earlier than in older people.,Its analysis for the BBC shows that 74% of cancers are diagnosed at either stage one or stage two in people under 40 in England. That figure falls to 46% in people over 40.,That feeds through into survival figures too. If you look at five-year survival figures in nearly all cancers, 15-40-year-olds have the highest survival rates, and the chances fall as you age. ,Only 1% of deaths from cancer - around 2,200 a year - are in people under the age of 40.,There are notable exceptions to this pattern. Cancer Research UK says survival rates improve in breast and bowel cancer once people reach screening age and seemingly healthy people are checked to see if they have a tumour growing in their body. ,For example, bowel cancer is more likely to be found at stage 4 in people who aren't screened (one in four cases in the under 50s) than in those who are eligible for screening (one in five over 50s).,But everyone agrees that you can't screen everybody and it should be concentrated in people who are most likely to benefit. Screening isn't 100% accurate, costs money, and can lead to harm and unnecessary treatment when lots of healthy people are tested. ,Screening ages:,Cervical cancer - 25 to 64 yearsBreast cancer - 50 to 70 yearsBowel cancer - starts from 50 in Scotland, 60 in England, but is being gradually lowered to 50, 58 in Wales and 60 in Northern Ireland,There is clearly room for improvement in cancer diagnosis and treatment for people, young and old. ,The International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership has the difficult challenge of comparing cancer statistics across different countries. It compared seven cancers in seven similar countries - Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and the UK. ,The UK is bottom for survival in five of the cancers, the analysis in the Lancet Oncology showed. ,Finding cancers is an issue. Before the pandemic, about a fifth of cancers in England were diagnosed only when somebody became so ill they ended up in Accident and Emergency. This could be a bowel cancer becoming so big it actually blocks the intestines, causing a medical emergency. It is no surprise, but cancers found in these circumstances are mostly (around three-quarters) late-stage tumours that are harder to treat, meaning survival is less likely. ,The pandemic has made the situation worse, with people not getting checked out and the health service coming under intense strain. GPs in England made more than a quarter of a million urgent cancer referrals in March - the highest figure since records began in October 2009. Cancer charities are worried that queues for tests and procedures which help diagnose cancers, are longer than ever. That creates pressure and delays, and puts people off seeking medical help. ,In an ideal world, says Cancer Research UK, people should not wait more than 28 days from being referred by their GP to finding out whether they have cancer - and start treatment within a month of diagnosis. ,But to meet these waiting time targets, the charity says GPs need good, timely access to tests: \"This will support and encourage [GPs] to refer patients at the earliest opportunity,\" says chief executive Michelle Mitchell.,And to improve early diagnosis, she wants the government to ensure \"the NHS has the workforce and equipment it so desperately needs\". ,Cancer charity Trekstock says there should be more focus on helping young adults live well during treatment and enjoy life after it's over. This means connecting people, giving them useful information and helping them thrive, says head of programmes Jemima Reynolds.,New tests could help speed up the process of diagnosis. ,For bowel cancer, a FIT (Faecal Immunochemical Test) - which looks for hidden blood in poo - can be carried out at home, and used by your doctor to work out if further tests are necessary. ,If there is bleeding, you'll be offered a colonoscopy to find out the cause - when a tube with a camera on the end is placed into your back passage to look inside your large bowel.,A new, less invasive alternative is being used by some hospitals in England and Scotland. A colon capsule endoscopy involves a tiny camera the size of a pill being swallowed by the patient. It then takes thousands of pictures as it travels along the gut, allowing doctors to find the cause of symptoms. ,The NHS is also running a trial of a new blood test which looks for fragments of genetic material from cancerous cells to see if it can help diagnose 50 types of cancer at an earlier stage. But it's not yet known whether the test can help save lives. ,Some say greater awareness of cancer symptoms is what's needed - but knowing the symptoms of every cancer is a challenge too.,\"General awareness-raising is incredibly hard, and it's very expensive,\" says Genevieve Edwards, from Bowel Cancer UK. \"Just know your body and trust your gut, and if something isn't right, go and see your GP.\"\n",
      "A government consultation on how to tackle the nation's vitamin D deficiency problem ends on Sunday. ,One idea being floated is getting people to eat biofortified foods, such as mushrooms that have been exposed to UV light.,It is a process that makes the food extra-rich in the nutrient.,More than one in 10 adults in the UK is thought to be lacking in the sunshine vitamin, which is needed to keep muscles and bones healthy.,Too much vitamin D can be bad too though - a build-up of of it can cause too much calcium in the body.,That is why there is a debate about what is the best way to improve the nation's intake, since some people already get plenty. ,The England-only consultation, led by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities and the Department of Health and Social Care has asked for individuals or businesses to contribute with suggestions. ,The next step will involve a national campaign to improve the vitamin status of the population.,There could also be legislation passed to allow food producers to put more vitamin D in foods that don't naturally contain it, in a process known as fortification, as well as growing produce and breeding meat to be more vitamin D-rich through biofortification.,Margarines used to have to be fortified by law, but the government dropped that requirement in 2013 to reduce the amount of regulations dairy farmers had to follow.,Some people are concerned that if many foods were fortified with various vitamins and nutrients, we might end up consuming too many. However, Dr Stacey Lockyer, from the British Nutrition Foundation, says this is unlikely.,\"The safe upper limit for a nutrient, set by health authorities to help ensure that total intakes do not pose risks for public health, would always be carefully considered before the implementation of a food fortification policy,\" the nutrition scientist tells the BBC. ,\"Studies conducted across Europe - under the Odin Project - have looked at the inclusion of vitamin D-fortified foods, either singularly, but also in combination, and have concluded that diverse fortification strategies carry little risk of exceeding the safe upper limit for vitamin D and thus could safely increase population intakes.\",Should everyone be taking vitamin D?,People can get some vitamin D from their diet, but also make it in their skin when it is exposed to the sun. ,There is no exact figure for how much time should be spent in the sun, but the charity Cancer Research says people should always be careful about skin cancer risk. ,For a while now, the government has recommended everyone should consider taking daily vitamin D supplements during the autumn and winter to top up their levels.  ,Some people are more likely to be deficient - people who don't get outdoors much or who cover their skin, as well as people with naturally darker skin. ,During the pandemic, more than 900,000 vitamin D supplements were given to people who were clinically extremely vulnerable and those in care homes to help avoid more deficiencies.,These free supplements were discontinued in February 2021, which clinicians from the Royal Osteoporosis Society (ROS) say is concerning, because it could lead to more people developing osteoporosis. ,\"Elderly people in particular face a perfect storm if vitamin D supplements are not made readily available, as do vulnerable individuals who cannot get out for UV exposure over a UK summer,\" they tell the BBC.,Now only eligible pregnant women, new mothers and children under four can get free supplements, which contain folic acid, vitamin C and D as part of the Healthy Start scheme.,\"Targeting these groups is helpful but doesn't address the magnitude of the problem that exists from cradle to grave,\" they add.,Supplements can be purchased from most supermarkets and pharmacies, with a three-month supply costing under £3.,You should be able to get the right amount of vitamin D just by going out in the sun between March and September in the UK.,But during the winter months, the sun will not be enough.,Foods that naturally contain vitamin D include oily fish like salmon, sardines, herring and mackerel, red meat and egg yolks.,Some products, like breakfast cereals, are fortified with vitamin D, meaning it has been added to them. Researchers are also exploring biofortification - for example, rearing animals to produce vitamin-D rich beef, pork, chicken and eggs. ,UV mushrooms for vitamin DTesco launches vitamin D-enriched mushrooms,There are two important forms of vitamin D - D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol). D2 generally comes from plants, such as mushrooms, while D3 comes from animal sources, such as eggs and fish, as well as our skin when it is exposed to the sun. Both D2 and D3 can be found in supplements. ,Most Vitamin D supplements contain vitamin D3, which is typically produced from a wax called lanolin, extracted from sheep's wool, and so may not be suitable for vegans or those who do not consume dairy.,Dr Lockyer says you can still get the vitamins you need when you're vegan or vegetarian.,\"Eggs are a useful source of vitamin D for vegetarians who eat them,\" she tells the BBC. ,\"Other food sources of vitamin D that are suitable for vegetarians and vegans are foods fortified with vitamin D such as some plant oil-based polyunsaturated fat spreads, some plant-based dairy alternatives - choose unsweetened versions - and some breakfast cereals - where fortified with a form of vitamin D suitable for vegans.\",Dr Lockyer also says vitamin-D enriched mushrooms can be purchased instead of regular ones to help increase intake. ,Research from March this year by YouGov found that nearly a third of adults (29%) in the UK can't identify a dietary source of vitamin D, while more than half of UK adults (54%) don't take any vitamin D supplements at all during the year.,The research, which was conducted on behalf of the ROS, also found that despite the pandemic providing more opportunity for many people to spend more time outdoors, adults were actually going outside less.,A total of 30% of UK adults said they were spending less than an hour outside on an average day, while 64% said they were spending two hours or less outside. ,ROS chief executive Craig Jones says he is pleased the government is running the consultation, and wants free supplements to be top of the agenda.,\"There are still people facing barriers to good bone health, and we're concerned that the rising cost of living might prevent even more people from following the advice to supplement,\" he says. ,\"Access to information and supplements should be available to everyone who needs it, and they shouldn't have to choose between their finances and their bone health.\" ,Dr Lockyer has also expressed the British Nutrition Foundation's issues with vitamin D consumption in the UK, and says \"multiple strategies\" are needed to improve it throughout the population. ,\"Not getting enough vitamin D can lead to an increased risk of bone deformities such as rickets in children, and bone pain caused by a condition called osteomalacia in adults,\" she says. \n",
      "The NHS needs to devolve more power to local areas in England and reduce the number of staff working in national organisations, a think tank says.,The Policy Exchange found there had been big rises in staff employed by NHS England and government in two years.,Its review said the numbers should be cut and more power given to the local NHS to run care such as chemotherapy.,NHS bosses said changes were being planned, but extra staff had been needed to fight Covid.,The think tank accepted the pandemic had played a role in the rise in staff at NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care. ,But it questioned just how big the central infrastructure of the health service had got over the past decade, saying the way it was currently run was \"ripe\" for reform.,It looked at what are called specialised services. These are things such as proton beam therapy and children's heart surgery, that are only done at a few sites across the country. As a result, they are run centrally by NHS England.,But the budget has grown rapidly over recent years from £13bn in 2013 to more than £20bn now - accounting for a sixth of the budget.,One of the problems, according to the Policy Exchange, is that even relatively common treatments, such as chemotherapy, kidney dialysis and adult heart care, are classed as a specialist services.,The think tank said responsibility for such services should be given to local services as part of an attempt to streamline the national bodies.,And while accepting the pandemic required extra staff, it criticised just how much the numbers employed at national organisations had risen. ,It pointed out the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) workforce had more than doubled to 4,000 in the past two years, while NHS England's had risen by two-thirds to more than 10,000.,The DHSC said extra highly-skilled staff had needed to be recruited to deal with the \"unprecedented demands of the pandemic\", including the rollout of the testing and vaccination programmes.,NHS England has also taken on staff from other bodies, including statisticians and health education staff, as part of a restructuring of responsibilities across national bodies.,And a spokesman for NHS England said the way services were run was being overhauled, with the introduction of what are known as integrated care systems which would \"improve care\" and lead to some of the changes for which the think tank was calling.\n",
      "Four more people in England have been diagnosed with monkeypox. ,The UK Health Security Agency says the risk to the public remains very low, although it appears the individuals caught it in the UK. ,Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to West Africa. ,The new cases - three in London and one in north-east England - do not have any known links with two other cases confirmed on 14 May or another case announced on 7 May.  ,The UKHSA says investigations are under way to establish links between the latest four cases, who all appear to have been infected in London. ,Currently, common contacts have been identified for two of the four latest cases. All four self-identify as gay or bisexual. ,The UKHSA says anyone with concerns that they could be infected should see a health professional, but make contact with the clinic or surgery ahead of a visit. ,If you get infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear.,Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. ,A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body.

      " When Hana found out she was pregnant, she knew she wanted to have an abortion - but her search for a clinic on Google led her to an anti-abortion centre, set on talking her out of her decision.,In many US states, BBC News has seen misleading websites advertising these clinics appearing high up in Google search results - and Facebook adverts with inaccurate medical advice - while genuine abortion providers are having their ads rejected and accounts restricted. ,Advice centres, such as the one visited by Hana - a 19-year-old living in the north-eastern US state of Massachusetts - are often run by Christian organisations.,They may offer some medical services such as pregnancy tests and ultrasounds - but some of their online promotion falsely suggests they also provide pregnancy-termination services.,It wasn't until Hana was walking down the centre's corridor, lined with posters comparing the procedure to murder, that it began to dawn on her this was not the abortion clinic she believed it to be. ,Hana describes herself as a \"nerdy researcher\", studying a health-related course at college - but nothing about the clinic's website tipped her off to the service it actually provides. ,The home page says: \"Take control - start with a free abortion consultation.\" And in a tab labelled: \"Get care,\" it lists the types of abortion (medical and surgical) that can be performed during different trimesters of pregnancy, under the heading: \"You just found out you're pregnant and want to know your options.\",Once there, Hana says, she was told, inaccurately, abortions were linked to infertility and breast cancer - and having had a Covid-19 vaccine, she might lose the pregnancy anyway, making abortion unnecessary, despite the evidence suggesting vaccinated people are no more likely to miscarry and, in fact, better protected against the risks of pre-term and still birth associated with Covid.,She was also pressured to view the ultrasound scan against her wishes.  ,\"What kind of mother doesn't want to see a picture of their child?\" asked the person attending to her.,Hana was left feeling deceived and betrayed. ,The Human Coalition, an anti-abortion group providing marketing for the centre and more than 40 others, told BBC News: \"We find in our work, most abortion-determined women do not desire an abortion, they desire help.,\"We're here to empower women by filling that gap - connecting women to the care and support they want, to choose life.\",Google displays adverts above search results for certain terms. ,Advertisers bid to have their ads appear first, Google says, although the order should also be determined by \"relevance\" and \"overall quality\". ,But, Whitney Chinogwenya, of MSI Reproductive Choices (formerly Marie Stopes international) says, this creates a \"battle of budgets\", with regulated abortion clinics competing with anti-abortion clinics or unregulated pill providers for ad space on specific search terms. ,Several large global abortion providers have also told BBC News they regularly have their online material referring to abortion censored without explanation, including having YouTube channels suspended, social-media accounts restricted and Facebook and Google ads rejected. ,In 2019, having been criticised for hosting misleading adverts, Google tried to crack down on abortion-advice clinics, which are most common in the US but can also be found across Europe (including the UK), Africa and Latin America. ,In the US, UK and Ireland, anyone running an ad mentioning abortion must first apply for a certificate. ,Ads from advice clinics not offering abortions can still run but will be given a disclaimer the advertiser \"does not provide abortions\".,Hana says she did not see this disclaimer.,It appears in very small font underneath the search headline and description. ,Sarah Eagan, a researcher for campaign group the Center for Countering Digital Hate, questions whether Google should be taking money at all for anti-abortion ads that target keywords used by people actively seeking terminations.,The CCDH has also found anti-abortion ads promoting unproven medicines remaining on Facebook.,And at the other end of the spectrum, the researchers found Google's autocomplete function suggesting ineffective do-it-yourself abortion methods.,Kelly, like Hana, says she was given inaccurate medical information as she struggled to find an affordable and safe way to terminate her pregnancy in her home state of Texas. ,What is Roe v Wade ruling on abortion? What happens if Roe v Wade is overturned,Between jobs and without insurance, she could not afford \"an actual doctor's visit\" so searched for affordable clinics. ,Finding her way to an anti-abortion centre, Kelly says she was frightened with warnings she could \"bleed out\" and risk her life but not given the context medical abortion is an extremely safe procedure.,Kelly feels promoting free pregnancy tests targets low-income women.,The centre appears to be using organic search, not adverts, making it more complicated to regulate. ,It says its website clearly states: \"We do not refer or perform abortions,\" adding it provides \"free services annually to over 5,000 minority poor under-served single mothers\". ,Eventually, Kelly was prescribed termination drugs - just hours before she passed the 12-week limit for a safe medical abortion. ,But Elisa Wells, co-founder of Plan C, the organisation that helped Kelly access these abortion pills, says its online material is routinely \"disallowed for violating community standards\" on Facebook, Instagram and Google.  ,Google says it has clear policies governing abortion-related ads, some determined by local laws and regulations.,Some of the posts and channels flagged by BBC News had been removed in error and since reinstated, it said.,Facebook said it had restored a small number of incorrectly rejected ads for abortion providers.,Read more from Reality Check,Send us your questions\n",
      "A noisy gadget that works in a similar way to a metal detector is being recommended in draft guidance for the NHS to help spot and treat breast cancer that may have spread.,The Sentimag probe detects magnetised liquid, called Magtrace, injected into the tissue around the cancer. ,It tracks the fluid's journey - bleeping as it moves over the skin - to show where cancer may have seeded.,A surgeon can then sample or biopsy the region to check if cancer is present.  ,The draft recommendation by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) could help more hospitals in England and Wales perform checks. ,Currently, some hospitals use a harmless radioactive dye injection and a scan instead, but this is not universally available.,Lymph node surgery for breast cancerWhy do we have lymph nodes?,Jeanette Kusel, acting director for MedTech and digital at NICE, explained: \"People with breast cancer want to know if their cancer has been isolated or has spread to the rest of their body. The earlier this is established, the better the potential outcomes will be.,\"This technology is another option for surgeons who work in hospitals with limited or no access to radiopharmacy departments. The benefits include the potential for more procedures to take place, reducing the reliance on radioactive isotopes shipped into the country, and for less travel for people having a biopsy.\",The brown-coloured Magtrace liquid injection contains iron oxide, which is magnetic. ,Once injected, these particles are absorbed into the lymphatic system, following the route that cancer cells are most likely to take when they spread from a tumour and become trapped in lymph nodes, often in the armpit.,Magtrace also stains the lymph nodes dark brown, which helps with identification when doctors do a biopsy.,Some patients might notice some brownish skin colouration near the site of injection in the breast tissue, but this fades with time.,Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"This promising research could provide a new tool for our scientists to track and slow the spread of breast cancer, the most common cancer in the UK.,\"The NHS already screens more than two million women a year for breast cancer and offers a range of treatments, which have helped save thousands of lives and tackle the Covid backlogs.,\"We are always on the lookout for innovative treatments to speed up diagnosis and improve survival rates.\"\n",

      "It is more than four years since the UK's first so-called buffer zone was set up outside an abortion clinic in the London borough of Ealing.,The aim was to prevent anti-abortion campaigners approaching - and often upsetting - patients. ,Pro-choice campaigners had hoped buffer zones - which are legally-protected spaces - would soon become the norm. ,But since 2018, only two more have been created in England, and BBC Newsnight has been told women are being regularly harassed.,Anti-abortion groups deny their gatherings target women, and say that instead they are prayer vigils meant to offer help and support.,They say that rolling out buffer zones would \"criminalise prayer\".,However, patients say gatherings can make them feel \"fear\", \"distress\" or \"shame\".,Pro-choice campaigners say the current requirement for evidence to support the establishment of a buffer zone is too demanding.,They point to an example in Bournemouth where hundreds of pieces of evidence said to demonstrate the negative impact gatherings have had outside the local clinic were submitted to the council. These included statements from women with learning difficulties, teenagers and rape victims. ,A buffer zone has not been enforced.,In April, more than 100 people attended a vigil outside Queen Elizabeth University Hospital Glasgow, raising concern among dozens of doctors.,A study by Aston University found that anti-abortion campaigners draw public attention to people entering and leaving abortion clinics, and sometimes persist in trying to persuade women not to go ahead with the procedure after being told they do not want a conversation.,And pro-choice campaigners believe that a potential change in US abortion law - in which individual states may decide on its legality - could further \"embolden\" UK gatherings.,With a rise in early medical abortions at home, triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, it is often now women with more complex cases who are attending clinics and witnessing anti-abortion activity - such as Lauren.,Newsnight: Lauren's interview,When she was 20 weeks pregnant, her \"world was completely shattered\" when doctors told her that her baby had little chance of survival because of a heart complication.,The 33-year-old, from Glasgow, spent the following days trying to contemplate whether to end her pregnancy. ,She also found out she was due to have a girl, and named her Riley.,\"It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make,\" Lauren says, \"but then it was the easiest.,\"I knew I was doing what was best for her - but it was hard because I didn't want to give her up.,\"I remember every second - I remember saying goodbye. ,\"It was the hardest time of my life.\",Lauren's trauma was aggravated by having to pass gatherings outside the Queen Elizabeth's maternity unit.,\"They're a dark presence,\" she says.,\"It's hard enough losing your baby and knowing you've made that decision - but when you see signs saying, 'abortion is murder', you feel so judged.,\"I would keep my eyes closed until we reached the hospital.\",Ealing Council set up the first buffer zone outside an abortion clinic in 2018 by enforcing a public space protection order, giving local police the power to move, or even fine, anyone who breaches it.,Pro-choice campaigners then hoped protected spaces outside abortion services would become the norm - but only two more have been created, in Richmond in London and Manchester. ,More than 100,000 women in the UK attended abortion services targeted by activists in 2019, according to the latest data from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), a leading provider of abortions.,A BPAS clinic in Bournemouth is one of the most affected.,Anti-abortion campaigners stand near the entrance, so that anyone arriving or leaving has to walk past them.,They may try to speak to patients or hand them leaflets the clinic says contain \"misleading or medically inaccurate\" information.,One staff member says she has been followed and repeatedly called a \"murderer\".,Fellow midwife Miranda says: \"Some take it in their stride - but when those people are outside, there will always be at least one client who is distressed. ,\"We might have to help bring them in or escort them out.,\"Patients come to us for various reasons and that's no-one else's business - but we do see very vulnerable people, and that's the last thing that they need.\",The team at this clinic has been calling for a buffer zone for more than five years and showed Newsnight nine folders, including more than 580 handwritten statements, they say demonstrate the negative impact gatherings have had.,Separately, the local Sister Supporter Group has collected more than 100 pieces of \"evidence\", including photos of babies' clothing in nearby bushes.,Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council has viewed most of this content. It says the situation is under consistent review and if the \"evidential threshold is met, formal action will be considered\".,One of the largest anti-abortion movements in the UK, 40 Days for Life, which originated in the US, holds prayer vigils outside abortion services every Lent and autumn.,During those 80 days, 25 of the busiest abortion clinics and hospitals in England and Wales experience \"regular protests\", according to BPAS. ,They can range from a few days a month to every day.,\"Standing in the street does not constitute harassment - we offer help and we pray,\" international campaigns director Robert Colquhoun says. ,\"For a small number of women, that help is of interest and has been taken up many times.\",And any volunteer would be \"immediately disassociated\" if they acted inappropriately.,Efforts to address activity outside abortion services differ across the UK. ,Following increasing concerns for women's welfare, governments in Northern Ireland and Scotland are taking steps towards potential national buffer zone legislation.,Northern Ireland recently passed a bill to create buffer zones - but this has been referred to the Supreme Court to decide whether it interferes with rights to protest.,In Scotland, the first minister has promised to chair a round-table summit to discuss buffer zones, after expressing support for them.,The situation remains under review in England and Wales.  ,Some contributors asked that their surnames be withheld\n",

Currently around one in 10 nursing posts are unfilled.,Nursing and Midwifery Council chief executive Andrea Sutcliffe said it was \"good news\" that the register was at the highest level ever, given the pressures of the past two years. ,But she added that there were some \"warning signs\", saying the numbers leaving because of work pressure was troubling.,And she said the extent to which the UK had become reliant on internationally trained staff was another \"note of caution\".,\"These professionals make a welcome and vital contribution, but we can't take them for granted.\",She said the supply of international recruits could always be disrupted by global events or even another pandemic.,Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen questioned the sustainability and ethics of such a level of recruitment from abroad, and called for increased investment in domestic training and better pay for staff.,The government said the NHS followed ethical recruitment practices, by not recruiting from a red list of countries which have declared shortages of health care staff.,All parts of the UK have set out plans to increase the number of nurses and midwives in the NHS. ,There are signs that is having an impact on domestic supply routes. The overall number of nurses currently in training has started to rise after the reintroduction of some funding support for student nurses in England in 2020, three years after bursaries were scrapped.,In theory that should boost the domestic supply route.,Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the overall rise in nurse numbers was pleasing - and continued progress would help England achieve the government's manifesto promise to recruit 50,000 more nurses by 2024.,\"I'm determined to continue growing the workforce,\" he added.\n",

      "A common virus that usually causes cold-like symptoms has killed more than 100,000 children under five globally in 2019, research has found.,Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was particularly deadly in the very young, with 45% of those cases occurring in children under six months old.,Almost all the deaths occurred in low and middle-income countries.,Experts are calling for a vaccine to be developed and prioritised to these vulnerable groups.,In a normal year, RSV is responsible for 20,000 hospital admissions in the under-ones in the UK.,Parents should be alert to common winter virus,It is easy to treat, but without medical intervention it can become much more serious.,Deaths due to RSV dipped during the Covid-19 pandemic as social contact was reduced.,But Professor Harish Nair, of the University of Edinburgh, who co-authored the study, said we are now seeing \"a rebound\" in cases as normal life resumes. ,\"Covid-19 restrictions are easing around the world and the majority of the young children born in the last two years have never been exposed to RSV - and therefore have no immunity against this virus.\",Symptoms of RSV tend to appear in stages and can include breathing difficulties, coughing, irritability and a blocked or runny nose.For most children, it will be mild and can be treated at home with infant paracetamol or ibuprofen.Call the GP or seek medical advice if your child is not feeding normally, is breathing fast or has a high temperature that will not go down.Call 999 if you see the muscles under their ribs sucking in with each breath, your child is exhausted from trying to breathe or they are pale and sweaty. ,Dr You Li, co-author of the study, said the number of RSV cases was not a surprise, but they had not expected the deaths in the community outside hospital to be so high. ,Overall, the study estimated that three-quarters of RSV deaths occurred outside hospital. ,Dr Li said the high RSV death rate in low and middle-income communities was due to high population density, poor living conditions and limited access to health care.,He said: \"In some resource-poor settings, for every RSV death found in a hospital, there can be as many as 13 more RSV deaths in the community. RSV immunisation in low and middle-income communities would be an optimal solution to the prevention of RSV infections.\",Currently, several immunisation products and programmes are in advanced clinical development.\n",

      "If you're still reeling from the Covid pandemic, well sorry but there's another virus to get to grips with. This time it's monkeypox and there are around 80 confirmed cases in 11 countries, including the UK, that would not normally expect to have the disease.  ,So what is going on? Is it time to worry or are we getting overly excited having just lived through Covid?,Let's be clear: this is not another Covid and we're not days away from lockdowns to contain the spread of monkeypox. ,However, this is an unusual and unprecedented monkeypox outbreak. It has taken scientists who specialise in the disease by complete surprise and it is always a concern when a virus changes its behaviour.,Until now, monkeypox was pretty predictable. ,The virus's natural home is wild animals, which are actually thought to be rodents rather than monkeys. Somebody in the rainforests of Western and Central Africa comes into contact with an infected creature and the virus makes the jump across species. Their skin erupts in a rash, which blisters and then scabs over. ,The virus is now outside its usual home and struggles to spread so it needs prolonged close contact to keep going. So outbreaks tend to be small and burn out on their own. ,Small numbers of cases have cropped up elsewhere in the world before, including the UK, but all can be immediately linked to somebody travelling to an affected country and bringing it home. ,That is no longer the case. ,For the first time the virus is being found in people with no clear connection to Western and Central Africa It is not clear who people are catching it from Monkeypox is spreading during sexual activities with most cases having lesions on their genitals and the surrounding areaMany of those affected are gay and bisexual young men ,\"We're in a very new situation, that is a surprise and a worry,\" Prof Sir Peter Horby, the director of the University of Oxford's Pandemic Sciences Institute, told me.,While he says this is \"not Covid-Two\", he said \"we need to act\" to prevent the virus getting a foothold as this is \"something we really want to avoid\".,Dr Hugh Adler, who has treated patients with monkeypox, agrees: \"It's not a pattern we've seen before - this is a surprise.\",We know this outbreak is different, but we don't know why. ,There's two broad options - the virus has changed or the same old virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive. ,Monkeypox is a DNA virus so it does not mutate as rapidly as Covid or flu. Very early genetic analysis suggests the current cases are very closely related to forms of the virus seen in 2018 and 2019. It is too early to be sure, but for now there is no evidence this is a new mutant variant at play.,But a virus doesn't have to change in order to take advantage of an opportunity, as we have learned from unexpected large outbreaks of both Ebola and Zika virus in the last decade. ,\"We always thought Ebola was easy to contain, until that wasn't the case,\" said Prof Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ,It's not clear why gay and bisexual men are disproportionately affected. Are sexual behaviours making it easier to spread? Is it just coincidence? Is it a community that is more aware of sexual health and getting checked out? ,It may also be getting easier for monkeypox to spread. The mass smallpox vaccinations of the past would have given older generations some protection against the closely related monkeypox. ,\"It is probably transmitting more effectively than in the smallpox era, but we're not seeing anything suggesting it could run rampant,\" said Dr Adler, who still expects this outbreak to burn itself out.,Understanding how this outbreak started will help predict what happens next. ,We know we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg as the cases being detected don't fit into a neat picture of this person passed it on to that person etc. Instead many of the cases appear unrelated, so there are missing links in a chain that seems to spread across Europe and beyond. ,A recent massive superspreading event, in which large numbers of people gathered and caught monkeypox at the same venue such as a festival and then took it home to different countries, could explain the current situation.,The alternative explanation for so many unconnected people getting infected is if the virus has actually been bubbling along unnoticed for quite some time involving a lot of people. ,Either way, we can expect to continue to find more cases. ,\"I don't think the general public need to be worried at this stage, but I don't think we've uncovered all of this and we are not in control of this,\" said Prof Jimmy Whitworth, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ,But remember we are not in the same situation as we were with Covid. ,Monkeypox is a known virus rather than a new one, and we already have vaccines and treatments. It is mostly mild, although it can be more dangerous in young children, pregnant women and people with weak immune systems. ,But it spreads more slowly than Covid and the distinctive and painful rash makes it harder to miss than a cough that could be anything. This makes the job of finding people who may have been infected and vaccinating those at risk of catching it easier. ,However, the World Health Organization's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, has warned that \"as we enter the summer season... with mass gatherings, festivals and parties, I am concerned that transmission could accelerate\".,Follow James on Twitter \n",
      "UK officials say they have identified another 34 cases of unusual liver inflammation or hepatitis in young children, bringing the total to 197.,Eleven of the children have needed a liver transplant. ,Scientists are still not certain what is causing it, but investigations suggest a common virus called adenovirus could be connected. ,Some other countries in Europe have reported similar cases. At least one death has occurred. ,The likelihood of children developing hepatitis is still extremely low, says the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Most children who catch adenovirus - a bug that causes sickness, diarrhoea and colds - will not become very unwell. ,Most of the children affected are five years old or younger, and have had symptoms of gastroenteritis illness - diarrhoea and nausea - followed by jaundice or yellowing of the skin and eyes (a sign that the liver is struggling).,Other symptoms of hepatitis in children include: ,dark urinepale, grey-coloured pooitchy skinmuscle and joint paina high temperaturefeeling unusually tired all the timeloss of appetitestomach pain,Adenovirus infections have been rising after virtually disappearing during the first year of the pandemic when nations went into lockdown and people stopped socialising and mixing. ,Experts say the recent spate in hepatitis cases might suggest a new strain of adenovirus is circulating, or young children with no previous exposure to adenovirus may be getting sicker when they finally do catch it.,Child hepatitis: Why are we seeing an unusual spike?,Dr Renu Bindra, senior medical adviser at UKHSA, said: \"We continue to remind everyone to be alert to the signs of hepatitis - particularly jaundice, look for a yellow tinge in the whites of the eyes - and contact your doctor if you are concerned.,\"Our investigations continue to suggest that there is an association with adenovirus infection, but investigations continue to unpick the exact reason for the rise in cases.\",Children with symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea should stay at home until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped.,And making sure children wash their hands thoroughly can help to reduce the spread of lots of common infections.\n",

Monkeypox: Time to worry or one to ignore?,The virus has now been detected in 16 countries outside Africa.,Despite being the largest outbreak outside of Africa in 50 years, monkeypox does not spread easily between people and experts say the threat is not comparable to the coronavirus pandemic. ,\"Transmission is really happening from skin-to-skin contact, most of the people who have been identified have more of a mild disease,\" Ms Van Kerkhove said. ,Another WHO official added that there was no evidence the monkeypox virus had mutated, following earlier speculation over the cause of the current outbreak.,Viruses in this group \"tend not to mutate and they tend to be fairly stable\", said Rosamund Lewis, who heads the WHO's smallpox secretariat.,Meanwhile, a top EU health official has warned that some groups of people may be more at risk than others.,\"For the broader population, the likelihood of spread is very low,\" said Dr Andrea Ammon of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. ,\"However the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact for example during sexual activities amongst persons with multiple sexual partners is considered to be high\".,Monkeypox has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex.,Dr Ammon suggested that countries should review the availability of the smallpox vaccine which is also effective against monkeypox.,In the UK, which has now recorded 57 cases, authorities are advising anyone who has had close contact with a confirmed case to isolate for 21 days.,A person is considered at high risk of having caught the infection if they have had household or sexual contact with someone with monkeypox, or have changed the bedding of an infected person without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).,Symptoms, which include a high temperature, aches, and a rash of raised spots that later turn into blisters, are typically mild and for most people clear up within two to four weeks.\n",

      "Black and Asian women are being harmed by racial discrimination in maternity care, according to an inquiry. ,The year-long investigation into \"racial injustice\" was conducted by the charity Birthrights.,Women reported feeling unsafe, being denied pain relief, facing racial stereotyping about their pain tolerance, and microaggressions. ,The government has set up a taskforce to tackle racial disparities in maternity care.  ,Hiral Varsani says she was traumatised by her treatment during the birth of her first child. ,The 31-year-old from north London developed sepsis - a potentially life-threatening reaction to an infection - after her labour was induced, which she says was only spotted after a long delay. ,\"I was shivering, my whole body was aching, my heart was beating really fast and I felt terrible. But everyone kept saying everything was normal,\" she says. ,\"It was almost 24 hours later before a doctor took my bloods for the first time and realised I was seriously ill.\" ,Hiral had an emergency C-section and her daughter was taken into intensive care after also contracting sepsis. ,Why are black mothers at more risk of dying?Miscarriage: 'I was in pain - they did not listen',She believes her race played a role in her care: \"I experienced microaggressions and was stereotyped because of the colour of my skin.,\"The staff would say 'hello princess', and while I was having contractions in a corridor a midwife walked past and said, 'Oh, you're definitely going to need an epidural'. I had never even met her before. ,\"I was repeatedly ignored, they just thought I was a weak little Indian girl, who was unable to take pain.\",While death in pregnancy or childbirth is very rare in the UK, there are stark racial disparities in maternal mortality rates.,Black women are more than four times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than white women in the UK, while women from Asian backgrounds face almost twice the risk. ,Tinu Alikor was terrified she would become one of those statistics when she gave birth to her daughter 14 months ago. ,The mother-of-three from Kent says she was \"mistreated and unheard\" during her maternity care each time, but says her most recent experience was perhaps the worst. ,During Tinu's second trimester, she had heavy, unexplained bleeding, and said she begged for an examination. ,\"The blood was getting worse, I was scared, I thought I was losing my baby. I've have had two miscarriages before.  ,\"The doctors refused to examine me and just said I had a UTI. I was told I still had four days till the end of my antibiotics course, and I remember saying, 'four days to what - till I bleed to death'?\",When Tinu was eventually examined, she was immediately taken to hospital because of a serious bleed coming from her bladder, and she needed several blood transfusions. ,\"If I had not have been hospitalised, I don't think I'd be sitting here right now. And I don't think my daughter would be. I've met some amazing midwives and doctors but I think all my experiences in my pregnancies and labour have been tainted by my race. ,\"With all three of my labours, I wasn't given any pain relief. I had to beg for it during my first two births, and even then, I was only ever given gas and air.  ,\"Racial stereotyping has got a lot to do with it. There is an assumption that black women have a higher pain tolerance. I don't know where this comes from. It doesn't hurt any less because I'm black.\" ,The Birthrights investigation - supported by the law firm Leigh Day - found common themes across the testimony it heard. These included: ,Black and brown women reported feeling physically and psychologically unsafe during their careHealth care professionals failed to recognise serious medical conditions such as jaundice in black babies because \"white bodies\" were considered the normWomen described racial stereotyping, microaggressions and assumptions - leading to distress and trauma. One of the most common experiences was that of black, brown and mixed ethnicity women reporting pain relief being denied or delayed because of racist stereotypes, including black women's perceived ability to tolerate pain and Asian women's perceived inability to cope with painThere were many accounts of women and staff hearing Asian women being referred to as \"princesses\" or \"precious\" and black women as \"aggressive\" or \"angry\"Some women and health care professionals shared examples of overt racism, such as hearing staff saying that black women and babies have \"thick, tough skin\", that the ward \"smells of curry\" when south Asian families were being cared for, and that Chinese people are \"dirty\",Melissa Brown, a midwife and officer for Birthrights, said maternity services were facing immense challenges. ,\"We did hear positive examples of maternity care, but there is racism and racial discrimination at a structural and individual level which is putting black, brown and mixed ethnicity women at harm. There are many complex reasons for poorer health outcomes for ethnic minorities, and racism and discrimination is definitely playing a role.\"  ,The Birthrights report - which will be sent to MPs - highlights the need for urgent action, including training for health care professionals which highlights diversity.,A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the Maternity Disparities Taskforce would \"level up maternity care for all women\".,\"It will address factors linked to unacceptable disparities in quality of care, experiences and outcomes.\"\n",

      "A rash can be caused by lots of things, including - but very rarely - monkeypox virus. ,What are the things you should check and consider?,The first thing to ask yourself is - do you think you could have been exposed? It takes close, prolonged contact - often skin-to-skin - with an infected person. There are very few people in the world who currently have it, meaning there are not that many opportunities to catch it. ,Even in remote parts of some African countries where it can sometimes circulate, children rarely contract it. ,If you were to get sick with monkeypox, the first thing you would notice is flu-like symptoms - feeling tired, generally unwell and feverish. It's what doctors call the \"invasion period\" of the disease, when the virus enters your cells. ,Your glands would feel swollen because your immune system is ramping up to fight the infection.,Next comes the rash, which goes through different \"skin eruption\" phases. It starts off flat and red, but then gets bumpy and blistered, before forming scabs.,Dr Rosamund Lewis from the World Health Organization's Emergencies Programme explains: \"It starts with what we call macules. These are just red areas. Then it progresses to papules. This is something you can feel. It's raised.\",Those red lumps and bumps then start to blister, and fill with a whitish fluid that looks like pus. ,These pustules then begin to dry out and scab over. Eventually, the scabs will heal and drop off.,\"This is why it can be confused with chickenpox,\" says Dr Lewis. ,A monkeypox rash usually starts on the face - sometimes in the mouth too - and then the arms and legs, hands and feet, as well as the trunk of the body.   ,In some of the recent cases, the rash has often been around the genital area. Dr Lewis says: \"The rash may not be visible because it may be covered.\",The rash - which may look slightly different on different skin tones - can contaminate bedsheets and clothes. ,The advice from the UK Health Security Agency is to be aware of any unusual skin changes or lesions, especially around the genitals, and for people to contact NHS 111 or a sexual health service if they have any concerns.,Dr Tanya Bleiker, President of the British Association of Dermatologists says: \"Differentiating between different types of rashes can be difficult. So if in doubt, follow the advice and get it checked.\",What is Monkeypox?,James Gallagher explains what it is and if we should be worried.,Available now on BBC iPlayer,There are many possibilities, but some common ones include:,Chickenpox,This rash is usually very itchy and goes through similar stages, ending with scabs. It is possible to get chickenpox more than once in your life - adults can get it again, even if they had it as a young child.  Shingles - reactivation of the chickenpox virus - also causes a rash. It can appear in blotches, and is usually painful.,Scabies,Scabies is caused by mites that lay eggs in the skin, which make it very itchy and red. The rash can appear anywhere on the body, but often starts between the fingers. You might notice lines or tracks on the skin as well as dots. While it is not serious, it is very contagious and needs treating.,Bedbugs or insect bites,You can get bitten by bedbugs if the bedding or mattress that you are sleeping on is infested with them. The bugs themselves are tiny, so you may not notice them. Like other insect bites, the lesions are itchy and red, and are often grouped in a line or cluster. ,A sexually transmitted infection (STI) like syphilis or genital herpes,Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is usually caught by having sex with someone who is infected, and genital herpes is a virus that can be sexually transmitted. Both can cause blisters. It's important to get tested and treated as soon as possible, if you think you might have an STI. ,Hives/allergy/urticaria,This itchy, stinging, red rash is a skin reaction to something that the body thinks is a threat and reacts to. Sometimes the trigger is never found, but common ones include eating certain foods or contact with certain plants, chemicals or medicines. ,Molluscum,This common viral infection, often seen in children, is harmless but can spread around the body, causing itchy, firm, raised spots that have a small dimple in the middle. Clusters of them tend to occur in the armpit, behind the knees or in the groin. You can catch it from skin-to-skin contact or by touching contaminated objects, such as towels.,Hand, foot and mouth disease,This viral infection is spread by coughs and sneezes, as well as contaminated household items such as cutlery. It can cause flu-like symptoms, as well as sores in the mouth and a red rash on the palms and soles of the feet. It usually gets better on its own.,Impetigo,This contagious bacteria usually infects skin that is already damaged, causing red sores and oozing, crusty blisters - often on the face. Although it can look severe, it can be cleared up with antibiotic cream.\n"
