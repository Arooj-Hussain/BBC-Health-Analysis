      "['The Human Coalition, an anti-abortion group providing marketing for the centre and more than 40 others, told BBC News: \"We find in our work, most abortion-determined women do not desire an abortion, they desire help.', 'But, Whitney Chinogwenya, of MSI Reproductive Choices (formerly Marie Stopes international) says, this creates a \"battle of budgets\", with regulated abortion clinics competing with anti-abortion clinics or unregulated pill providers for ad space on specific search terms.', 'Finding her way to an anti-abortion centre, Kelly says she was frightened with warnings she could \"bleed out\" and risk her life but not given the context medical abortion is an extremely safe procedure.', 'Several large global abortion providers have also told BBC News they regularly have their online material referring to abortion censored without explanation, including having YouTube channels suspended, social-media accounts restricted and Facebook and Google ads rejected.', ' When Hana found out she was pregnant, she knew she wanted to have an abortion - but her search for a clinic on Google led her to an anti-abortion centre, set on talking her out of her decision.', 'In many US states, BBC News has seen misleading websites advertising these clinics appearing high up in Google search results - and Facebook adverts with inaccurate medical advice - while genuine abortion providers are having their ads rejected and accounts restricted.', '\"Once there, Hana says, she was told, inaccurately, abortions were linked to infertility and breast cancer - and having had a Covid-19 vaccine, she might lose the pregnancy anyway, making abortion unnecessary, despite the evidence suggesting vaccinated people are no more likely to miscarry and, in fact, better protected against the risks of pre-term and still birth associated with Covid.']\n",
